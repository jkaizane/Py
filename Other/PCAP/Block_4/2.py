#What is true about OOP?

#Encapsulation is a phenonenom which allows you to hide certain  class traits from the outer world
"""Lets you hide sensitive object components and protect them from unauthorised modification"""

#A part of a class desgined to build new objects is called a constructor.
"""The constructor is a function called __init__(). You can use it to initialise the new object's state"""
