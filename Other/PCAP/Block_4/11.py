#The built-in class property called __bases__ is:

"""A tuple, which contains information about the direct superclasses of the class.

The three most important aspects are:

1. it is a tuple
2. it contains superclass data
3. only direct superclasses are included.

Missing any of the above would make the sentence incorrect.
