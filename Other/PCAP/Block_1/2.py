# The following code snippet is used to import and invoke the c() function. What is always true about the function and its environment?

import a.b.c()


# The b component is a module, and it is contained inside the a package, or is a submodule of a.
#The phrase import a.b determines the fact that a is either a package or a module.

#The c() function is contained in the b module.
#The phrase imprt a.b determines the fact that b is a module, hence the above statement is true.
