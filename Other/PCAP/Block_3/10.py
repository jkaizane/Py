#Which of the following expressions evalaute to True and raise no exceptions?

'Analog' < 'analog'
#In ASCII, upper-case leters are less than their lowercase counterparts, hence the comparison evaluates to True

' ' * 0 < 1 * ' '
"""Because an empty string, which appears on the left side of the comparison (as a result of the ' ' * 0 operation)
is the least string of all, the comparison evaluates to True"""
